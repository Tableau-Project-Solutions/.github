# Welcome to my Tableau Projects! <br><br/>

Tableau is a collaborative data visualization software for organizations working with business information analytics. Organizations use Tableau to visualize data and reveal patterns for analysis in business intelligence, making the data more understandable.

It's possible to use Tableau Prep Builder for automating data cleansing tasks bu building refreshable pipelines. It's simple to use, however it's still lacking behind SQL or even Power Query options.
